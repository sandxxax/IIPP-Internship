2.	Incorporating Sysmon Logs into Wazuh: The incorporation of Sysmon logs into Wazuh provides a detailed insight into system-level activities, offering a comprehensive view of critical events like process creation, file modifications, and network connections. This integration enhances Wazuh's understanding of endpoint activities, facilitating seamless correlation between system-level events and network-level indicators. By leveraging Sysmon's granular data, security teams gain the ability to detect and investigate potential threats that encompass both network and endpoint components. This unified approach strengthens Wazuh's overall threat detection capabilities, empowering organizations to build a cohesive defense strategy against sophisticated cyber threats.

3.	Integration of virus total in wazuh: The integration of VirusTotal into Wazuh significantly strengthens the platform's threat detection capabilities by harnessing the comprehensive analysis provided by the VirusTotal API. Wazuh's File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) feature continuously monitors files and directories for changes, triggering alerts when suspicious activity is detected. This integration ensures a proactive response to potential threats by seamlessly engaging VirusTotal. When a change occurs, the integration extracts file hashes from the alert and initiates an HTTP POST request to compare them with the VirusTotal database. The resulting JSON response is then utilized to trigger alerts within the Wazuh environment, providing security teams with detailed insights into potentially malicious content and bolstering overall cybersecurity defenses.

By combining Wazuh's proactive monitoring capabilities with the extensive analysis capabilities of VirusTotal, this integration empowers organizations to swiftly identify and respond to emerging threats, contributing to a more resilient and secure cybersecurity posture. This comprehensive approach enables security teams to make informed decisions and prioritize responses based on a deeper understanding of the detected activity.

4.	Incorporating Suricata into Wazuh for Network Analysis: The integration of network analysis through Suricata into the Wazuh platform signifies a pivotal advancement in bolstering overall cybersecurity defenses. Suricata, renowned for its prowess as both an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention System (IPS), offers real-time monitoring and analysis of network traffic. By seamlessly incorporating Suricata logs into Wazuh, organizations gain a comprehensive view of their network's security landscape, empowering them to identify and respond to potential threats swiftly. This integration enables Wazuh to leverage Suricata's rule-based language, combining anomaly, protocol, and signature inspection methods for the detection of diverse malicious activities, including denial-of-service attacks, buffer overflows, and various other network-level threats. The enriched threat intelligence from Suricata enhances Wazuh's capabilities, allowing security professionals to proactively defend against sophisticated cyber threats by correlating network-level events with broader security indicators, ultimately fostering a more resilient and adaptive security posture. Network Packets and logs can be analyzed in detail for more information about the attacker.

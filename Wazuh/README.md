# Introduction to Wazuh
Wazuh is an open-source security information and event management (SIEM) platform designed to enhance threat detection, intrusion detection, and response capabilities for organizations. Rooted in a robust combination of log analysis, intrusion detection, vulnerability detection, and security information management, Wazuh provides a comprehensive solution for monitoring and managing security events across an entire IT infrastructure. Originally developed as OSSEC-HIDS (Host-based Intrusion Detection System), Wazuh has evolved into a scalable and extensible platform that aids organizations in fortifying their cybersecurity posture.

The core functionality of Wazuh revolves around its ability to collect, analyze, and correlate data from diverse security-related sources, such as logs, events, and configurations. With a focus on real-time threat detection and response, Wazuh helps organizations proactively identify and mitigate potential security incidents. Its open-source nature fosters community collaboration, enabling users to leverage a wealth of security expertise and contribute to the continuous improvement of the platform. Wazuh's user-friendly interface, coupled with its flexibility and powerful features, makes it a valuable asset for organizations seeking a robust and customizable solution to bolster their cybersecurity defenses.

# Installation
We canâ€™t install Wazuh directly in Tpot , so I am building Wazuh in my t-pot as a Docker file.
Docker is an open platform for building, delivering, and running applications inside software containers. Docker containers package up software, including everything needed to run: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries, and settings. Docker enables separating applications from infrastructure. This guarantees that the application always runs the same, regardless of the environment the container is running on. Containers run in the cloud or on-premises.

We can deploy Wazuh as a single-node or multi-node stack.

- Single-node deployment: Deploys one Wazuh manager, indexer, and dashboard node.

- Multi-node deployment: Deploys two Wazuh manager nodes (one master and one worker), three Wazuh indexer nodes, and a Wazuh dashboard node.

Sysmon Alerts will be generated in Wazuh

## 3.	Integration of virus total in wazuh:
The integration of VirusTotal into Wazuh significantly strengthens the platform's threat detection capabilities by harnessing the comprehensive analysis provided by the VirusTotal API. Wazuh's File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) feature continuously monitors files and directories for changes, triggering alerts when suspicious activity is detected. This integration ensures a proactive response to potential threats by seamlessly engaging VirusTotal. When a change occurs, the integration extracts file hashes from the alert and initiates an HTTP POST request to compare them with the VirusTotal database. The resulting JSON response is then utilized to trigger alerts within the Wazuh environment, providing security teams with detailed insights into potentially malicious content and bolstering overall cybersecurity defenses.

By combining Wazuh's proactive monitoring capabilities with the extensive analysis capabilities of VirusTotal, this integration empowers organizations to swiftly identify and respond to emerging threats, contributing to a more resilient and secure cybersecurity posture. This comprehensive approach enables security teams to make informed decisions and prioritize responses based on a deeper understanding of the detected activity.

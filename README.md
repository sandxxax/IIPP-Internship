# IIPP-Internship Documentation
My IIPP Internship was for 3 months in the field of cyber security and my Internship goals were:
(1) read the MITRE Engage documents;  select one of the goals in mitre engage which is  'Expose'  to study deeper and define each action under these goals in detail.
(2) Propose possible actions to be implemented in SSH honeypot. There are about 10 to 20 actions listed under expose goal. Try to propose corresponding actions for this honeypot. 
(3) Real implementation:you need to implement at least four actions(System Activity Monitoring, Network Monitoring, Network Analysis, Malware detonation.) according to your design in (2) in the real honeypot.

**Enhancing Tpot CE Honeypot Through the Implementation of MITRE Engage Goal ‘Expose’**










The MITRE Engage framework provides a strategic and comprehensive guide for cybersecurity 
professionals to actively engage adversaries, emphasizing the importance of proactive defense through 
cyber denial, deception, and adversary engagement. Traditionally, cyber defense focused on denying 
adversaries access to networks, considering any access or data exfiltration by the adversary as a win. 
MITRE Engage introduces the concepts of cyber denial and deception to increase ambiguity for adversaries, 
driving up their operational costs and reducing the value of their cyber operations.
Cyber denial involves preventing or impairing the adversary's ability to conduct operations, limiting their 
movements and effectiveness. On the other hand, cyber deception intentionally reveals deceptive facts and 
fictions to mislead the adversary, creating uncertainty and hindering their decision-making. When used 
together strategically, cyber denial and deception form the pillars of adversary engagement, which aims to 
expose adversaries on the network, elicit intelligence about their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), 
or affect the adversary by impacting their ability to operate.
Adversary engagement involves creating carefully tailored and highly instrumented environments, often 
seamlessly integrated into production networks, to actively engage adversaries. The MITRE Engage Matrix 
serves as a shared reference for planning and executing adversary engagement activities, bridging gaps 
between defenders and decision-makers. It categorizes actions into strategic and engagement categories, 
further dividing them into goals, approaches, and activities.
The three main engagement goals are Expose (uncover adversaries on the network), Affect (negatively 
impact their operations), and Elicit (gather information about their TTPs). These goals guide defenders in 
planning operations to achieve specific outcomes aligned with organizational goals. The Engage Matrix 
provides a structured approach with strategic and engagement actions, allowing defenders to plan, execute, 
and iterate on adversary engagement activities. It emphasizes that engagement is an iterative, goal-driven 
process, requiring thoughtful planning and intentional execution to drive progress toward strategic cyber outcomes.

## Introduction to Tpot CE Honeypot

### Honeypot:
A honeypot is a security mechanism that creates a virtual trap to lure attackers. An intentionally compromised computer system allows attackers to exploit vulnerabilities so that we can study them to improve our security policies. We can apply a honeypot to any computing resource from software and networks to file servers and routers.

Honeypots are a type of deception technology that allows us to understand attacker behavior patterns. Security teams can use honeypots to investigate cybersecurity breaches to collect intel on how cybercriminals operate. They also reduce the risk of false positives, when compared to traditional cybersecurity measures, because they are unlikely to attract legitimate activity.
Honeypots vary based on design and deployment models, but they are all decoys intended to look like legitimate, vulnerable systems to attract cybercriminals.<br>

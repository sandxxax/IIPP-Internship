## Introduction to Tpot CE Honeypot

### Honeypot:
A honeypot is a security mechanism that creates a virtual trap to lure attackers. An intentionally compromised computer system allows attackers to exploit vulnerabilities so that we can study them to improve our security policies. We can apply a honeypot to any computing resource from software and networks to file servers and routers.

Honeypots are a type of deception technology that allows us to understand attacker behavior patterns. Security teams can use honeypots to investigate cybersecurity breaches to collect intel on how cybercriminals operate. They also reduce the risk of false positives, when compared to traditional cybersecurity measures, because they are unlikely to attract legitimate activity.
Honeypots vary based on design and deployment models, but they are all decoys intended to look like legitimate, vulnerable systems to attract cybercriminals.<br>

## Implementation of Mitre Engage Expose Goals

The 4 Mitre Engage Expose goals which I have implemented in my T-pot Honeypot includes:

#### 1. Network Monitoring
#### 2. System Activity Monitoring 
#### 3. Malware Detonation 
#### 4. Network Analysis 

Let's review each of them individually:

### 1. Network Monitoring (ID: EAC0002):
- Monitoring network traffic is a fundamental aspect of cybersecurity, involving the systematic observation and analysis of data exchanged within a network. The comprehensive practice encompasses the collection of server and firewall logs, which are then centralized for in-depth scrutiny. This centralized approach facilitates efficient and centralized analysis, allowing defenders to identify anomalous traffic patterns and activities that could signify the presence of adversaries. This process serves as a cornerstone for situational awareness, providing cybersecurity professionals with crucial insights into the dynamics of their network.

- Effective network monitoring requires meticulous pre-operational planning to ensure the comprehensive collection of critical network traffic. This planning is essential for creating a robust foundation that aids in the detection of unexpected outbound traffic and the identification of known adversary command and control (C2) protocols. By incorporating both automated tools and manual analysis, defenders can gain a nuanced understanding of network behavior, enabling them to discern normal activities from potentially malicious ones. This proactive approach to network monitoring not only enhances the ability to detect adversarial threats promptly but also strengthens the overall resilience of the cybersecurity infrastructure.

### 2. System Activity Monitoring (ID: EAC0003):
- System Activity Monitoring is a pivotal cybersecurity measure that involves collecting comprehensive system activity logs, offering a detailed account of user logins, actions, and various events within an environment. This proactive approach provides defenders with invaluable insights into potential adversary activities and the tools employed, forming a crucial aspect of threat detection and response. Snort and itâ€™s usage in system monitoring  helped me understand the overall importance of this activity.
  
- The captured logs, when centralized for in-depth analysis, become a powerful tool in understanding and mitigating potential security threats. However, the effectiveness of this monitoring strategy relies on meticulous planning to strike a balance between the depth of data collection and avoiding data overload, ensuring that defenders can focus on relevant information without being overwhelmed.
  
- These system activity logs play a crucial role in enhancing situational awareness and operational safety. They contribute to a comprehensive understanding of adversary tactics, guiding the strategic selection of logs to monitor. The careful pre-operational environment setup is paramount to the success of system activity monitoring, as it ensures that the collected data is not only relevant but also manageable for analysis. By incorporating this measure, organizations can significantly strengthen their security posture, enabling a proactive response to potential threats and reinforcing the resilience of their cybersecurity infrastructure.

### 4. Network Analysis (ID: EAC0004):
- Network Analysis is a crucial component of cybersecurity that involves the thorough examination of network traffic to extract valuable intelligence on communications between systems. Malicious traffic analysis  is the critical aspect of this activity. The primary goal is to uncover potential adversary activities, such as command and control (C2) traffic or data exfiltration, which are indicative of malicious intent. This process requires capturing and scrutinizing network traffic, often necessitating the development of custom protocol decoder frameworks capable of handling complex encryption and proprietary protocols. While creating these decoders demands technical expertise, the insights gained from such efforts are invaluable in understanding and mitigating potential threats.
  
- The complexity of modern cybersecurity threats often requires advanced techniques for deciphering encrypted network data. Through network analysis, security professionals can employ custom decoders to decrypt network data, exposing adversary C2 actions or data exfiltration attempts.

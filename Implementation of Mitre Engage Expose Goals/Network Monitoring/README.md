# Network Monitoring (ID: EAC0002):  
- Monitoring network traffic is a fundamental aspect of cybersecurity, involving the systematic observation and analysis of data exchanged within a network. A generalized network monitoring  was a very resourceful paper, which I studied to implement the Network Monitoring. The comprehensive practice encompasses the collection of server and firewall logs, which are then centralized for in-depth scrutiny. This centralized approach facilitates efficient and centralized analysis, allowing defenders to identify anomalous traffic patterns and activities that could signify the presence of adversaries. This process serves as a cornerstone for situational awareness, providing cybersecurity professionals with crucial insights into the dynamics of their network.

- Effective network monitoring requires meticulous pre-operational planning to ensure the comprehensive collection of critical network traffic. This planning is essential for creating a robust foundation that aids in the detection of unexpected outbound traffic and the identification of known adversary command and control (C2) protocols. By incorporating both automated tools and manual analysis, defenders can gain a nuanced understanding of network behavior, enabling them to discern normal activities from potentially malicious ones. This proactive approach to network monitoring not only enhances the ability to detect adversarial threats promptly but also strengthens the overall resilience of the cybersecurity infrastructure.

## Network Monitoring Using Suricata:
- Suricata stands as a formidable force in the realm of cybersecurity, serving as a robust open-source intrusion detection system (IDS) and intrusion prevention system (IPS). This versatile tool seamlessly integrates intrusion detection system (IDS), intrusion prevention system (IPS), and network security monitoring functionalities, offering organizations a comprehensive solution to safeguard their intricate network infrastructures. Developed and maintained by the Open Information Security Foundation (OSIF), Suricata stands as a testament to community-driven efforts in enhancing cybersecurity. The collaborative nature of its development, facilitated by OSIF, fosters a community-driven approach to threat detection and prevention.

- Functioning as both an IDS and IPS, Suricata empowers organizations to actively monitor network traffic for potential security threats and enact preventative measures to mitigate these risks. Its open-source nature not only reflects a commitment to transparency but also encourages community involvement and continuous improvement. As a valuable asset in the cybersecurity landscape, Suricata's effectiveness lies in its ability to analyze and respond to network threats in real-time, contributing to a proactive and resilient defense against evolving cybersecurity challenges. In conclusion, Suricata stands as an exemplar of community-driven cybersecurity, harmonizing the roles of IDS, IPS, and network security monitoring.
